Release 1.2 - Formatting improvements.

Now will hyphenate very long words intelligently (new in 1.2.1), avoiding table overflow
Tries to avoid wrapping of the CVE title where possible (but will wrap for very long IDs we've not seen yet)
Closed vulnerabilities now in a much compressed format as there's no need to list the affected packages. Can save a huge amount of space.
