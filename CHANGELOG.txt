Release 2.0.1:

Fixed offline mode

Release 2.0:

Massive update...

TrivySummary will now attempt to download EPSS scores for each CVE and graph each CVE,
CVSS (severity) against EPSS (exploitability), unless asked to operate in offline mode.

TrivySummary can be given minimum CVSS and EPSS thresholds above which CVEs should be
marked as high priority for remediation.

TrivySummary will now show applicable NVD and RedHat links for each CVE, aiding 
assessment.

BREAKING CHANGE: --failThreshold parameter now renamed --failSeverityThreshold and the
default is no longer to fail on any severity.  In return, if this isn't set and
prioritisation is in effect (as above), then any high priority CVEs would return an
error code.
